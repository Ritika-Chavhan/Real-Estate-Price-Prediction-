# **Real Estate Price Prediction**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting real estate prices based on various factors such as location, property size, and amenities. The dataset has been cleaned and preprocessed, and machine learning models have been implemented to generate price predictions.

## 🔥 Features
- **📊 Data Collection:** Scraped real estate data from various sources.
- **🧹 Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
- **📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized trends and relationships between variables.
- **🤖 Machine Learning Model:** Implemented regression models for price prediction.
- **📊 Dashboard Visualization:** Created a Power BI dashboard for insights.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of:
- 📍 Location information
- 📏 Property size (sq. ft.)
- 🏠 Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- 💰 Price of the property
- 🏡 Additional amenities (parking, garden, etc.)

## 🛠 Installation
To set up the project, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning and model prediction:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook cleaning_data_and_model_prediction.ipynb
   ```
2. Load the cleaned dataset into Power BI for visualization.
3. Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE and R-Squared.

## 📊 Model Performance
The implemented regression models were evaluated using:
- 📉 Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
- 📊 R-Squared (R²) score

## 🏗 Technologies Used
- **🐍 Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **📊 Power BI** (for dashboard visualization)
- **📓 Jupyter Notebook** (for model training and testing)

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- 🚀 Improve feature selection and engineering.
- 🤖 Explore deep learning models for better accuracy.
- 🌐 Deploy the model as a web application.
